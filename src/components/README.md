# React Components Folder

## Wrapper components
Most of the visual components in this folder such as `DateInput` have 
corresponding wrapper components such as `DateInputWrapper`. The 
purpose of these wrapper commponents is to
- keep the component itself as simple as possible, and
- provide the connection between the component and the data store.
