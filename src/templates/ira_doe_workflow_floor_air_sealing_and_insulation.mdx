    Prior to air sealing and insulating the floor joists (ceiling of an unconditioned crawlspace/basement ceiling) above an 
    unconditioned space check the outside grade slope, gutter and downspout. Inside the unconditioned crawlspace/basement 
    check the condition of the wood framing, vapor barrier, foundation wall, drain system, water and sewer pipes, and 
    electrical wires. Look for dryer vents, exhaust fans, and combustion appliances venting into the unconditioned 
    space instead of outside. Look for signs of pest entry. If the home is in an area where high radon is common, 
    look for a radon mitigation system. If the home is in a seismic, hurricane, or tornado zone look for hold downs and 
    lateral bracing.  If there are ducts hanging below the elevation of the floor joists, they must be air sealed and 
    insulated prior to this work.

      Installing only batt insulation into the floor cavity is not best practice because that method doesn’t result in a vapor 
      barrier. The recommended three methods are shown in the heading figure, which all result in a vapor barrier. 
      The installation of rigid foam insulation that covers the floor joist, rigid foam covering the floor joist with batt 
      insulation inside the floor joist cavities, or close cell spray foam insulation that covers the floor joist tips are 
      all acceptable best practice methods for air sealing.
