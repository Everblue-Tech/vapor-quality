    <PhotoInput id="exhaust_vent_termination_photo" label="Exhaust Vent Termination – Photo">
      Take a wide-angle photo of the exhaust vent termination.
        -	To show that the vent is far enough away from windows, doors, soffits, eaves, crawlspace vents, and air intakes. All clearance requirements are in accordance with ANZI Z21 .10.3 and the National Fuel Gas Code, ANSI Z223.1 / NFPA 54 and CGA 8149.1 National Gas and Propane Installation Code.
        -	To show that the wall penetration for the vent has been flashed correctly.
        -	Install the termination high enough so that snow drifts won’t block the vent.
        -	Install termination fittings in a manner to prevent short circuit of air from exhaust to intake. 
        -	The installation of bird screens are recommended

    <PhotoInput id="intake_vent_location_photo" label="Intake Vent Location – Photo">
      Take a wide-angle photo of the intake vent location if different/not shown in the previous image.
      Example: If the intake is in an unconditioned attic, this photo would show that it is sufficiently above or away from attic insulation.
    </PhotoInput>

    <PhotoInput id="condensate_management_piping_photo" label="Condensate management Piping – Photo">
      Take a photo of the condensate management piping. Photo must include the connections to the combustion air inlet moisture trap, AC coil, acid neutralizer, secondary drain pan, and condensate pump if used.

    <PhotoInput id="installation_location_at_completion_photo" label="Installation Location at Completion – Photo">
      Take a wide-angle photo of the installation location at completion. 
      -	To show that there are no adjacent hazards, if installed in a garage this photo would show that the installation is at least 18 in. above the floor and protected from vehicle damage.
      -	To show the water pipes have been insulated especially the hot water pipe and recirculation lines if present.
      -	To show the air inlet air filter has been clearly labeled for periodic inspection
      -	To show the condensate neutralizer (if used) has been clearly labeled for periodic inspection
      -	To show the temperature and pressure relief valve has been installed and correctly terminated
