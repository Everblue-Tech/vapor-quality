    ## Existing Condition
    <Collapsible header="Existing Condition Details">
    The existing conditions of the home must be evaluated prior to installing mechanical ventilation. This includes evaluating:
        1.	Unavoidable point sources of indoor air pollution (e.g. showers, cooktop)
        2.	Avoidable point sources of indoor air pollution (e.g. back drafting combustion appliances)
        3.	Natural non-point sources of indoor air pollution (e.g. envelope air leakages)
        4.	Occupant caused non-point sources of indoor air pollution (e.g. smoking, pets, air fresheners, incense) 
        5.	Outdoor air pollution levels (e.g. proximity to a busy street, neighbor’s smoking, wildfire smoke). 

    The type of mechanical ventilation equipment and strategy should:
        1.	Capture unavoidable point sources of indoor air pollution near the source of emission, e.g. a exhaust fan should be in each full bath, and a range hood that exhaust to outdoors installed over the cooktop. 
        2.	Not cause naturally drafting appliances to backdraft even under worse case conditions. See the Combustion Appliance Safety section in the Post-Installation tab for recording the combustion safety test results. Combustion appliance safety testing is only required if the home has one or more natural draft combustion appliances post-retrofit.
        3.	Effort to air seal the envelope to minimize natural non-point sources of indoor air pollution coming from an attached garage, unconditioned crawlspace, unconditioned attic, dusty walls.
        4.	Take into consideration ASHRAE 62.2 calculation as well as occupant caused non-point sources of indoor air pollution.
        5.	Take the level of chronic and intermittent outdoor air pollution levels into account.

    ## General Safety
    <Collapsible header="General Safety">
        Some homes have existing mold or moisture issues. For the contractor’s protection and the safety of the customer, it is important to inspect for pre-existing mold or moisture issues. Some common causes of mold or moisture issues include a leaky roof, leaky ducts and clogged gutter or drainage systems.
    </Collapsible>

    <Collapsible header="Roof condition">   
    * Look for water stains, mold, or signs of pest entry. Water and moisture issues from a leaky roof can be made worse once the attic has been air sealed and insulated because afterwards there is less heat escaping to dry the roof/attic.
    * Pest entry can rapidly damage air sealing and insulation materials thus it is important to check and remediate prior to work. 
    </Collapsible>
    <Radio label="What is the roof condition?" options={['Good','Potential Issue']} path="roof_condition" />

    <Collapsible header="Drainage condition"> 
    Check the grade around the home is sloped away from the house, check for standing water in the crawlspace or 
    basement floor, check the gutters and downspouts are in good condition. Once the attic has been air sealed and 
    insulated there is less heat escaping to dry the roof/attic thus water damage caused by clogged gutter will be 
    much worse. Once the attic has been air sealed and insulated the amount of air exfiltrating through the attic 
    is reduced and therefore the amount of air infiltrating into the crawlspace/basement is also reduced. 
    Thus, even though attic air sealing and insulation of the attic is being performed, it can reduce the drying 
    force of the crawlspace/basement, thus pre-existing moisture problems in the crawlspace/basement can be made 
    worse by this action. Thus, it is a good practice to check and document pre-existing problems.

    <Radio label="What is the drainage system condition?" options={['Good','Potential Issue']} path="drainage_condition" />

    <Collapsible header="Mold or Moisture in or Outside the Home"> 
    Contractors should perform this inspection prior to work as protection against being blamed for a pre-existing 
    mold or moisture problem. Air sealing and insulation can make a pre-existing mold or moisture problem worse, 
    thus it is important to check for the safety of the customer.

    <Collapsible header="Pre-retrofit ASHRAE 62.2 calculation"> 
    *	The pre-retrofit ventilation calculation can help estimate whether mechanical ventilation will be needed post air sealing and insulation work.
    *	Consider infiltration credits. A very leaky home may still be leaky enough after the scoped air sealing and insulation work is completed. 
    *	The ASHRAE 62.2 standard does not require the installation of a system smaller than 15 CFM (7 L/s)
