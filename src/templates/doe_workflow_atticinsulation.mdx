        ## About the Report:
        This report is intended to show:
        1. The critical details of the attic insulation upgrades that were performed.
        2. The subsequent air leakage rate of the home after all the air sealing and insulation work
        in the scope of work has been performed.
        The report is not intended to be technically exhaustive, neither every single feature nor every
        example of every feature was photographed. The report does not imply that every single
        location that could have been air sealed and insulated was air sealed and insulated 100%
        perfectly, however, the contractor has made diligent effort to be meticulous and do a quality
        job.
        
        ## About Naturally Drafted Fossil Fuel Appliances Inside the Home
        Naturally drafted fossil fuel appliances inside the pressure boundary of the home will be tested
        for proper draft and combustion during the pre-envelope upgrade health and safety inspection.
        However, there is the possibility that the comprehensive envelope air sealing and insulation
        energy efficiency upgrades could cause the naturally drafted water heater or furnace to fail to
        draft properly when dryers, range hoods, and exhaust fans are operated simultaneously with
        the naturally drafted water heater and/or furnace. If this is found to be the case, a combustion
        air opening connecting the combustion appliance area to the outdoors may need to be added
        or some other remediation may be required. The homeowner/landlord should be aware of this
        possibility and the costs of this remediation action.
        
        ## About Mechanical Ventilation
        One important aspect of a comprehensive energy efficiency upgrade is taking control of the air
        flowing in and out of the home. Without proper air sealing, the air flows in and out wherever it
        wants to, and primarily when it is very hot or very cold. This leads to comfort issues (drafts) and
        wasted energy. It also leads to moisture problems when the moisture in that air gets into the
        wall, attic, or floor assemblies. To avoid these issues while providing adequate fresh air where
        and when it is needed, the strategy is to seal air leaks, especially high (attic) and low (basement
        or crawlspace) and then provide continuous mechanical ventilation with optional filtering or
        other conditioning.
